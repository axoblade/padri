                  PADRI in collaboration with researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), UK  conducted a study for the evaluation of the Merck for Uganda Mothers (MUM)-Profam Social Franchise in Uganda. The study involved a cross-sectional survey of women 760 who had attended a MUM-ProFam facility for ANC and/or delivery care and who had delivered in the last three months prior to the time of the survey to understand their pathway of care and their experiences of care during the current pregnancy.  The study also involved a facility survey involving 15 randomly selected ProFam facilities (eight PFP and seven PNFP facilities) stratified by type of delivery services provided – whether the facility was providing Comprehensive Emergency Obstetrics Care) or Basic Emergency Obstetrics Care. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with women, community health workers, franchisees and staff of the implementing agency in Uganda (PACE) to draw out perceptions and experiences of the social franchise - including costing and quality of care - alongside unstructured observations at the facilities. We conducted Interviews were with the facility managers/in-charge to understand the changes each social franchisee went through when joining the MUM programme. The survey was conducted from July to November, 2015 in 1 districts (“i.e”. Wakiso, Kiboga, Kayunga, Jinja, Kyenjojo, Kabarole, Ibanda, Hoima, Bukedea, Soroti, Amolatar, Lira, Gulu and Nebbi district) in  Central, Southwest, Western, Northern and Eastern Uganda.  The evaluation was funded by Merck International through the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London.

                  The Government of Uganda (GoU), through the National Planning Authority (NPA) commissioned PADRI to develop a Local Government (LG) development Issues paper for the National Development Plan II 2015/16-2019/20 to guide the implementation of the Uganda Vision 2040, of "A transformed Ugandan Society from a peasant to a modern and prosperous country within 30 years". PADRI conducted country-wide consultations with LG leaders at district, Municipality and sub-county levels (including both political and technical leadership); and other stakeholders at national level, to elicit their views on the priority development issues for the NDP II. The Key issues that were explored include: Improving the functionality of the LGs for effective service delivery, by  improving the LG revenue base; improving the capacity and levels of staffing; strengthening the planning function and monitoring and evaluation of LGs; and addressing governance issues - particularly   addressing the high levels of corruption; and improving the capacity and competencies of the political leadership (mostly councillors) at LG level, to perform their policy-making and oversight functions. Other issues were: Improving Community mobilization for development; promoting the Local Economic Development (LED) and promoting comprehensive physical planning for urban development. The study was conducted between March and October 2014 and funded by GoU.
