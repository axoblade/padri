                  This project aimed at assessing the impact of providing improved water services to peri-urban households in Kampala district. The survey for the project was conducted in 69 parishes, involving a total of 1004 households. The household information collected included: socio-demographic data, time use, water needs and, sources of water and associated costs- including time spent for collection and reasons for choice of water sources used. The survey also collected data on food consumption (both purchased and home-grown), quantity and quality of household assets such as housing, and other household goods as a measure of household welfare. Biometric data (i.e. weight and height) for children 7 years and below was also recorded to assess the impact of improved water services on child development. The study was undertaken in 2011 and funded by Global Partnership on Output Based Aid of the World Bank

                  PADRI researchers, in collaboration with research colleagues from, the Faculty of Business & Administration Uganda Christian University undertook a study to explore the costs of motorcycle accidents and the pain, grief and sufferings of the motorcycle accident victims using a multi-method approach. The specific objectives of this study were to estimate the direct and indirect costs of motorcycle accidents; establish the pain, grief and suffering of motorcycle accident victims; and draw policy recommendations for improving road safety in Uganda. The data was obtained from multiple sources, including survey of 1600 motorcycle riders (popularly known as boda boda) in Kawempe and Central divisions  Kampala Capital City Authority, interviews with accident victims and their immediate family members,  traffic police records, hospitals and national statistics. Data from the survey of motorcyclists and from the qualitative interviews were used to estimate and describe the tangible and intangible costs of motorcycle accidents- both for fatality and severe injuries. The Willingness-to-pay (WTP) approach was used to estimate the value that boda boda riders would pay for reducing the risk of loss of life based on Contingent Valuation (CV) method.  The study also explored the key coping mechanisms adopted by the Boda-boda riders amidst the challenges the riders face when they suffer motorcycle accidents. The unique contribution of this approach is that it offers an in-depth investigation of the pain, grief and suffering by drawing on rich qualitative interviews conducted with the Boda-boda riders who have suffered a motorcycle accident and the family members of the Boda-boda riders who died because of motorcycle accidents. The estimates showed that it costs approximately UGX 7 million (about US 2300 in 2014 prices) to treat a boda boda accident victim who is severely injured. This study was conducted between Nov 2013 and June 2014 and funded by CrossRoads, UK.

                  PADRI staff conducted a process evaluation of the distribution of Long Lasting Insect-treated Nets (LLIN), under the Stop Malaria Project by Malaria Consortium in Uganda.  The process evaluation identified the strengths and challenges to of the LLIN distribution during ANC visits at health centres to inform future programmes on the distribution of LLIN through health facilities in Uganda. Fieldwork was conducted in Kayunga, Hoima, Ssembabule, Mityana, Kumi and Serere district- covering a total of 38 health facilities. The evaluation was done through a health facility survey, and in-depth interviews with the in-charge and /administrators of the health facilities, the district health officer (DHO) and other members of the district health team (DHT), district Biostatisticians  and officials at the Ministry of Health, National Malaria control Program (NMCP).  The process evaluation focused at the LLIN distribution chain, including coordination, supervision, record keeping and reporting, LLIN distribution to beneficiaries, behavioural change communication; and beneficiary assessment. The evaluation was conducted from May - August 2013 and was funded by Malaria Consortium-Uganda.

                  PADRI in collaboration with researchers from the School of Economics Nottingham University UK and medical practitioners from Nottingham University Hospital NHS Trust participated in a randomized trial to evaluate the impact of providing orthotic equipment on life outcomes (economic and physical independence and wellbeing) for disabled adults in Uganda. The study was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, 800 people with physical disability (of the lower limb) were assessed and interviewed. Of these 400 were randomly assigned to the ‘intervention’ group and were allocated and assistive device depending on their condition, while 400 were assigned to the control group 9those who received no assistive device in the first phase). In the second phase,   all the 800 were reassessed and re-interviewed to establish the impact of the intervention and the same time, those in the control group were allocated an appropriate assistive device. The impact of the equipment on physical independence and the quality of life of individuals, changes in skills, employment opportunities and income were measured based on the data collected from the intervention and control group in the 2 phases of the study. In addition to a survey of the people with disability (PWDs) who participated in the study, focus group discussions (FGDs) were held with community members to understand the community attitudes towards PWDs. The project results provide academics, policy makers, the Government of Uganda and international donors with important evidence and policy options for improving the lives of persons with physical disability in Uganda.  Phase 1 fieldwork was conducted in June 2012 and phase 2 in June 2013.  The National Union of Disabled Persons (NUDIPU) and Uganda National Action for Persons with Disability (UNPD) were the local institutions which participated in the study.
